          <p>My name is <span itemProp="name">Michael Baird</span>, and you‚Äôve just found my website. Stick around and
            I'll tell you a little bit about myself, my hobbies and my interests. Don't have time? Here is a TLDR:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>I‚Äôm an experienced software developer with over two decades focusing on .NET technologies, web development, CI/CD automation, UX, design...among other things and dedicating a lot of time to improving peoples' lives with software.</p>

          {/*<h2>Early days of a Software Developer üê£</h2>*/}

          <h2>Contact Me üì¨</h2>
          <p>I'm usually pretty easy to get hold of, here's how I use different channels to communicate with people and how best to contact me.</p>
          <p>I get a huge amount of communications so this page lists the channels I use and how I like to use them. I'll usually respond to all legitimate comms, there's an outline down the bottom of what I probably won't respond to so please read that first.</p>

          <h3>Twitter: <a href={SOCIAL_TWITTER} itemProp="">@{SOCIAL_USERNAME}</a></h3>
          <p>This is my primary means of broadcasting things to the world so please follow me there. I do read my DMs and allow them from people I don't follow, but would prefer email if you're reaching out from the blue about something. I don't see every mention so you may not get a reply via a public tweet.</p>

          <h3>LinkedIn: <a href={SOCIAL_LINKEDIN}>{SOCIAL_USERNAME}</a></h3>
          <p>My background is pretty well covered for the last couple of decades there. I accept connections from people I've met, worked with, spoken with or otherwise had enough interaction to feel that I can call them a professional contact. I don't respond to requests from people I don't know.</p>

          <h3>What I may not respond to</h3>
          <p>I try and respond to technical queries but would prefer you try asking on Stack Overflow first.</p>
          <p>If your message doesn't explicitly look like it needs a response or it's vague or not clear what the purpose is, you may not hear back from me.</p>
